# Why WAAS?
The purpose of The Wide Area Augmentation System is to ensure GPS is a viable means of En Route Navigation, approach, landing and departure for airborne users.

What separates the Wide Area Augmentation System from other navigation aids is that it is space based and provides information to airborne users from 3 GEO Stationary Satellites and not from the ground like other navigational aids. From these satellites the WAAS signal is viewable throughout nearly the entire wester hemisphere.

WAAS ensures GPS viability for airborne users by increasing the accuracy, availability and integrity of GPS. Accuracy is improved by detecting the errors associated with each GPS satellite and proving a correction for each. The accuracy is further improved by adding a geographical based correction to account for the errors caused to the GPS Radio Frequency signal due to propagation delayed through the ionosphere. WAAS improves GPS availability by having each GEO Satellite also provide a ranging source to airborne users that is the same as GPS. This augments GPS in the case of a GPS satellite outages or poor satellite geometry. Last WAAS adds integrity to GPS by monitoring a range of performance issues and sending information to users about removing faulty satellites or the availability to use GPS in a geographic area due to ionospheric threats. WAAS has several different operational service types with the most stringent being LPVs which provide similar level of service to Category I ILS.

# What is WAAS?
The Wide Area Augmentation System is a differential GPS System that provides differential corrections for GPS and integrity information to airborne users. Specifically WAAS is a Space Based Augmentation System meaning that it provides its corrections from a satellite and not from the ground like other differential correction systems.  Having a space based transmitter give WAAS a very large coverage area and is not limited by structures, ground terrain, and line of site issues as is other ground base systems. It is intended to enable aircraft to rely on GPS for all phases of flight, including precision approaches to any airport within its coverage area.  


# Why can't we use GPS?
* GPS has no Integrity
* Poor Accuracy

# Why another landing system?


# How does WAAS work?
At it core WAAS is a sensor network where the sensor is a GPS antenna. WAAS tracks all GPS satellites in view at 38 locations ranging from Barrow, AK to Tapachula, Mexico and from Honolulu, HA to Gander, Canada.


# What is going on at MMAC?  You could pull a Raytheon and have WAAS is going on at....:)

Is there a pictorial way to consolidate the Why another nav system into one page?

The confusing part of the logic is you would read (stand alone) and expect a one for one alignment but there isn't a stand alone tie to Primary Means
I do like why another nav system, but as a lead in about WAAS for a stand alone is a little hard to follow.  Especially with so many slides.

it does have ground base infrastructure but the that corrects several error sources while utilizing the Global Positioning System. When these error sources are correct is increases the accuracy of GPS. WAAS utilizes three GEO satellites that provide a ranging signal just like GPS. These additional space base ranging sources provide additional availability over only GPS
